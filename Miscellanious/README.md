# Miscellaneous
The Miscellaneous folder holds several auxilliary scripts not essential to the success of the project, but useful nonetheless.

[**createGif.py**] - This script takes several .png images and combines them to form an animated .gif image.
[**merge_folders.py**] - Combines two folders, items appearing in both folders move to the root of a new folder, items appearing singularly move to a subfolder of that.
[**timerInformation.py**] - Print time elapsed and estimated time remaining for any function encapsulated in a tic/toc pair.
